# 🏀 Introduction to CompSci Final: NBA Trivia Website 🏆

## Project Description 📄

This project is a web-based NBA Trivia game developed by Arya and Brian. It's built using the Python Flask library and leverages the Antrhopic Claude API as a way to generate questions & answers.

## How to Play 🎮

The NBA Trivia game is a single-player experience. The user's objective is to guess the NBA team based on the provided information. For example, if the team is the Golden State Warriors, the user might be asked to guess the main colors of the team. If the user answers "blue," the game will respond with a confirmation that blue is indeed one of the team's colors.

The main category for the trivia questions is the number of championship rings the team has won. 💍
